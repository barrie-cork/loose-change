# üëã Welcome to Loose Change Discussions!

The community exists to make billionaire wealth more comprehensible through relatable financial perspectives. This discussion board is a place to collaborate, share feedback, and improve the methodology behind the Loose Change wealth comparison tool.

## üí¨ Your Input Matters

Economists, financial experts, educators, and curious users are all welcome to help shape this project. Feedback is encouraged on:

- **Methodological improvements**: How might the comparison logic be refined?
- **Additional context**: What other references would help users visualise financial scale?
- **Data accuracy**: Any inconsistencies spotted in billionaire wealth figures?
- **Visualisation ideas**: What formats best convey financial inequality?
- **New features**: What functionality would improve the experience or add value?

Loose Change is an open, collaborative experiment‚Äîideas and questions help make it more meaningful and impactful.

## üîç About the Methodology

Loose Change translates billionaire financial transactions‚Äîdonations, fines, purchases‚Äîinto equivalent values for everyday individuals. The goal is to help people emotionally and cognitively relate to extreme wealth. The current approach includes:

1. **Net Worth Ratio**: A billionaire‚Äôs transaction is expressed as a percentage of their net worth and compared to a user‚Äôs annual income.
2. **Transaction Scaling**: The same proportion is applied to the user‚Äôs income to calculate an equivalent value.
3. **Contextual Examples**: Real-life metaphors (e.g. ‚Äúlike you buying a sandwich‚Äù) make comparisons more tangible.
4. **Work Hours**: Transactions are also expressed in terms of equivalent work hours based on the user‚Äôs income.

### Loose Change ‚Äì Core Calculation (Pseudocode)

```python
# Given:
W_b = billionaire net worth
T_b = billionaire transaction amount
I_u = user annual income

# Compute:
R = T_b / W_b
E_u = R * I_u

# Output:
E_u = user's equivalent transaction amount

Considerations and Limitations

Comparing billionaire net worth to an individual‚Äôs income is not a perfect match. Net worth reflects accumulated assets, while income is an ongoing flow, usually dedicated to essential living expenses.

Even when someone owns property or a vehicle, those assets are often heavily financed, with significant portions still owed to the bank. Billionaires, in contrast, typically hold appreciating assets that increase their wealth without equivalent debt.

Taxation introduces another imbalance. Though some systems are progressive on paper, lower- and middle-income individuals often face a higher effective burden, as essentials like rent, food, and transport take up a larger share of income. Wealthier individuals may see more of their gains sheltered or unrealised, making direct comparison even more challenging.

Despite these nuances, income offers a practical, accessible entry point for comparison. It helps bridge the abstract scale of billionaire wealth in a way most users can relate to.

Alternative comparison modes‚Äîsuch as net worth, savings, or disposable income‚Äîhave been explored, but introduce complexity:

Most people don‚Äôt track their net worth, and many carry debt.

Disposable income is difficult to measure consistently across individuals.

Public financial data is often fragmented or outdated.


The current version of Loose Change prioritises clarity and accessibility. More nuanced comparison modes may be introduced in future versions, with clear explanations and customisation options.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Was Built

Loose Change was created entirely using a no-code process, developed through natural conversation with Replit. No traditional programming was required‚Äîjust curiosity and the desire to test a simple but powerful idea.
